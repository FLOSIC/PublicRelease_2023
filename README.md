# FLOSIC_2023
#Hello everyone!,
#This version of the code was developed for large scale FLOSIC calculations with symmetry.
#The first paper published with work done from this code is J. Chem. Phys. 159, 154112 (2023)(https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0172300). 
#GRPMAT and FRMGRP files should have same symmetry operations and symmtery indipendent FODs should be given in FRMIDT file.
